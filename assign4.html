        Since the problem statement that emerged from the previous analysis is: How might we make a coach who wants to learn about basketball in her free time (who) address the problem of gathering information on different platforms, often considered incomplete and pointless, (what) so that she/he can save time and have access to what she/he wants whenever she/he (what) so that she/he can save time and have access to what she/he wants whenever she/he wants to make a change (why)? So the scope of the future journey and story mapping iterates as follows.
<br>1) Find a tactic<br>
2) Review and decide on one<br>
3) Match a training plan<br>
4) Apply it in practice<br>
5) Provide a strain reference in the real world<br>
6) Share your experience in the community

      <p>In response to this process, the supposed solution aims to monetise it by developing a business model of paid content for member subscriptions. The aim is to significantly save the time that users have to waste integrating information across different platforms. With a paid subscription to the platform, users can browse content from a wide range of platforms that have already been compared and filtered.
      </p>
      I also conducted usability tests to validate the monetisation logic for attracting targeted players to subscribe to the community membership. More descriptions can be found in my <a href="https://hkdesign.org/ive-tried-my-best/" target="_blank">journal</a>.
